<h3>Introduction</h3>

These are basic data structure implement in Nodejs. They are fo practice and include Trees, HashTable, Heaps, Queues, Priority Queues, Stacks and arrays. 

<h3>How it Works</h3>

In order for this code to work on your machine you need to clone the whole repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulCardoos/dataStructures-Javascript.git

```
navigate to the path where you cloned to repository

```
npm i

```
from this point you can run any file as you would run any node program. Make sure the code is together as the code requires some classes that are implement in the code to run. For example the BST requires the Node class.

no extra dependencies are needed

<h3>Extras</h3> 
This is a work in progress. I strive everyday to fully master data structure and algorithms
